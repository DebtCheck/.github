# 💡 DebtCheck

**Developer-first technical debt analysis.**

DebtCheck is a platform that helps teams **analyze and manage technical debt** with a single GitHub repository URL. We scan your TypeScript codebase using the GitHub API and a high-performance Rust microservice to detect:

- 🧱 Outdated dependencies & deprecated libraries  
- 🧹 Dead code and unused files  
- 🚨 Code smells & poor TypeScript practices  
- 🧪 Unstable or missing CI/CD configurations  
- 🔐 Security risks (e.g. exposed secrets, unsafe permissions)  
- 📚 Missing documentation  
- 🏗️ Obsolete frameworks or tech stacks

Get an actionable, structured report—with insights per file or per issue type—and stay in control of your code health. Built for engineers, by engineers.
